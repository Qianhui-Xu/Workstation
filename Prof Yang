- Exact Diagonalization code of 10.97.169.13 (1st workstation)
/home/yangbo/petsc-3.18.0/arch-linux-cxx-debug/bin/mpirun -n 20 ./main -o 18 -e 6 -f a -l2 0.00001 -nev 10 -eps_nev 10 -eps_ncv 30 -eps_mpd 30 -eps_max_it 100000000 -shift 1 -eps_tol 1e-14 -nz 1000 -v1 1000000 -v3 1

Note: the L2 could be settled to be 0, the eigenvalues we get after the ED procedure is the 'H+L^2'. If we set the l2 to be non-zero, 
we need to subtract the l(l+1) from the values we get directly to obtain the exact energy eigenvalues. The number we set is the value of l.

The larger the Hilbert spacs, the bigger the value of -nz we should set. But the greater the -nz value, the code will use more memory.
